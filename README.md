This is my first required project for freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design certification. There is a chance that one day, I will go back to these projects and review them to compare how much I've learned since starting to obtain certifications in the IT industry. With these first few courses, I learned the most common HTML tags by building my own cat photo app, how to design a menu page for a cafe webpage, different ways to set color values and pair colors with each other, how to control what types of data people can into my forms, and new CSS tools for styling my pages.
